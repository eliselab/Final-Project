            <p class="blog-text">For Kim, theatre is an exercise in empathy. His particular passion is in representation and identity politics, in particular, in cultural diversity. When we met at the Brunswick institution that is Greens, I asked Kim what he hopes his audience leaves with after seeing his work. In disagreement with traditional theatre as intending to shock and provoke the audience, Kim hopes to move and entertain is audience. After all, “if people are not entertained they won’t come back”. Kim hopes to raise difficult questions and make his audience think about where they stand in relation to those questions. His view is, that the best way to create change through theatre is to tell a good story but not offer any concrete solutions. Through Kim’s two main theatre productions, Athens Reborn and Mirror’s Edge, he has played with this fine balance. Both works highlight Kim’s current interest in finding the cracks in history and telling stories that may have been repressed in the past. </p>
            <p>Kim’s interest in the convergence of cultures drew him to investigate a small town in the Mallee by the name of Sea Lake. This visit inspired Mirror’s Edge, which explores cross-cultural relationships and spans over centuries. The current story of a town struggling to survive yet holding on to a lifeline which frequent Chinese tourists provide is interwoven with the indigenous history of the land. In producing Mirror’s Edge, Kim hopes to contribute to the ongoing de-colonisation of theatre by speaking from his experience as an Asian Australian. Kim produced Athens Reborn in 2014 during his time at university when he was studying Shakespeare and felt frustrated by the covert and overt sexism in Shakespeare’s plays. Kim set out to usurp the traditional patriarchal structures using Shakespeare’s own language and made women instrumental to the plot. Whilst Kim feels that as one of his earlier works, the politics were not particularly sophisticated, he did choose to work with an all-female cast and a female director to temper the fact that he was a male playwright. 
            </p>
            <p>All of Kim’s work is informed by his own ethics and his interest in representation, particularly cultural diversity. When I asked Kim to talk me through his passion for representation he explained that every artist he came across in his youth and the stories being told where not about people like him. All the faces he had to look up to, appeared the same, and he could not see himself represented there. “When you’re a minority in a majority white country and a majority white patriarchy, when you see yourself on stage it feels really good.” Kim has pinpointed what most of us main stream viewers of film and theatre have struggled to articulate. The reaction which Wonder Women generated is a perfect example of this. When women finally saw a female superhero character and could see themselves represented on screen in an empowering way, it opened up something many people had not realised they were missing on screen. To Kim, it is “depressingly absurd that people were crying in Wonder Woman because it is so rare to see a female superhero and one that isn’t just there for the male gaze.” As someone who left the screening of Wonder Woman feeling pretty great myself, I tend to agree. Kim feels a similar way when he sees shows about Asian Australians; for that show simply to exist means a lot to him. Kim hopes that this will just become part of how theatre and the film is, but for now, he aims to part of the vanguard in bringing more diverse faces and voices to theatre.

            <p class="blog-qoute">“Representation is the act of seeing yourself, or different people, portrayed on stage or onscreen through visual media”
            </p>
            <p>To add more statistical legitimacy to the discussion of increasing diversity in theatre, Kim recently wrote a report titled ‘Cultural Diversity in Australian Theatre 2017’. It highlights the challenges artists of colour face in the Australian theatre community and in breaking into the main stage. Less than a fifth of the productions in 2017 were written by a person of colour. Australian theatre and film are still rooted in European ways of thinking. Whilst cinema and theatre are European forms, Kim is interested in pushing those forms to see new interpretations of theatre and to bring more diverse people closer to the centre of the story being told. The greater variety of stories we are exposed to on stage provides us with more opportunity to exercise our empathetic side. Kim strongly feels that multiculturalism is strengthening our country and all multicultural societies. When we acknowledge and respect difference of opinion, skin colour and cultures our empathetic imagination grows and we can more rigorously test who we are as people and as a culture.

            <p>Kim’s interest in theatre, and his desire to pursue it, initially sat uncomfortably with him as he felt pressure to pursue a career path which was seen as a less “flippant” profession. It was not until Kim started university and had what he calls an “awakening” about both his craft and politics that reaffirmed what it was he wanted to focus on within theatre. Kim wonders if focusing on representation was simply a way for him to justify his career choice, I was convinced otherwise. In Kim’s own well-articulated, insightful way it was clear to me that his passion to be a positive agent for change in the theatre and film community is genuine and will help drive the future he hopes to see in the industry.
