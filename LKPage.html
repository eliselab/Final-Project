                <p class="blog-text">Lizz Kuiper finds writing comes naturally to her. She writes freelance for ‘Local Eyes’, an online lifestyle magazine and has been published in the literary magazine, Voiceworks of publishing house, Express Media. Lizz was later recognised by Express Media for Best Fiction Piece of an Express Media Publication which lead to her being published in the Award Winning Australian Writers Magazine in 2015. It was this published short story that gave Lizz the exposure she needed to be on her way to publishing her first novel.
                </p>
                <p>When I met up with Lizz to talk about her involvement so far in the writing industry it was clear Lizz has a passion for writing. She writes short fiction and is currently in the midst of working through the editing process of her novel. She talked about the importance of young writers being given a space for their voices to be celebrated without competing against writers with 20 odd years’ experience. Lizz settled on saying that Voiceworks is “fantastic” rather than adding another expressive f word; her excitement about the magazine was evident. Voiceworks plays an important role in creating an avenue for young writers under the age of 25 to be published. It was Voiceworks which gave Lizz the exposure to writers and publishers who saw the potential her work had to offer. After her short story was published in the magazine, Lizz had the opportunity to do a reading during an Emerging Writers Festival ‘Next Big Thing’ event. To Lizz, this may have felt daunting at the time, yet it was an opportunity which would prove to be pivotal.
                </p>
                <p>The different perspectives that new voices bring are really important to the writing industry. Lizz sees a positive push recently to make way for the voices of traditionally marginalised groups such as people of colour, LGBT communities, and young people. As well as established magazines such as Voiceworks, the rise of online forums for publishing has levelled up the playing field to allow young people, who previously didn’t have much social capital or connections, the opportunity to add their own dynamic stories to the mix. Whilst more access to self-publishing, social media and blogs has opened up the field, it has also created a highly competitive environment. In the current environment, particularly for new writers such as Lizz, having a social media presence is important as people are often more likely to buy into something they are familiar with. For Lizz, the shifting landscape of publishing is an opportunity, and she sees the variety that different voices bring as really valuable and exciting for the literary community. 
                </p>
                <p>Whilst it is fairly rare for new authors to be able to submit an unfinished manuscript and be picked up by a publishing house, Lizz had a vote of confidence from publisher, Aviva Tuffield. It was during the ‘Next Big Thing’ event that one of the participating authors with an upcoming book approached her publisher to suggest she keeps an eye on Lizz. Tuffield told Lizz to get in touch if she had any longer works to submit. During her undergraduate Arts degree, Lizz slowly worked away on her first literary fiction novel. Now, four years later, Lizz is on her way to being published by Black Inc. Snow in Africa is the working title of the novel which is told from the perspective of 11-year-old Hannah who is a white, privileged girl, living in Zimbabwe. The novel is set in the early 2000s and explores the political and economic turmoil in the country. Lizz is originally from Zimbabwe; whilst she makes it clear the novel is fiction, she did draw on her own context and experiences from living there to bring the story to life. The contrast between her previous life in Zimbabwe and her experience when she first moved to Perth is something which has stayed with Lizz and gave her a different perspective through which to view her home country. Lizz now calls Australia home, yet spent a moment reflecting on the fact that you often glamorise the image of your home land and look back with ‘rose-tinted glasses’. 
                </p>
                <p>The shift towards increasing the diversity of the voices in literature and allowing space for more perspectives is paving the way to a greater democratisation in the industry. Rose-tinted glasses or not, the opportunity and excitement of working on your first novel is something to celebrate.
