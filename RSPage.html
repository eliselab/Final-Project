        <p class="blog-text">What was initially a childhood obsession with skyscrapers for Rob Snelling later developed into a specific focus on sustainable building design. Our generation will first-hand experience social issues as a result of environmental challenge. We will also witness the implications of not developing sustainable cities. This realisation was a key driver for Rob to channel his energy and skills into sustainable building design. I asked Rob to tell me more about his passion and how he aims to make a difference. 
        </p><p class="blog-text">During Rob’s undergraduate degree he really began to appreciate the importance of sustainability. Through being involved in a number of societies and volunteering organisations he saw the social side of what engineering and design combined could achieve. To have an impact in creating positive change in the industry, Rob wanted to find his ideal area of study and profession that combined his interests, skills and values. Nothing in his architecture or engineering studies had really fit for Rob until he came across the book Elemental: Incremental Housing and Participatory Design Manual on social housing by Alejandro Arevena. Within a year this interest became a true passion, as Rob realised that with the right combination of practical skills and the ability to tackle the relevant issue, he would be able to bring a more practical slant to an area of study which has a tendency towards academia. Rob definitively expressed the view that architecture and sustainable design can, and should, have a larger impact than simply being beautifully designed buildings or spaces. For Rob, sustainable building design means the equal consideration of social, environmental and economic impacts of design.</p><p class="blog-text">Rob is particularly passionate about bringing the social element of sustainability into the foreground. Ensuring a “community inclusive focus” is important to develop spaces that really work for people. Human-centred design is key to understanding what people really need, rather than just what is perceived as needed by the designer or even people themselves. Rob speaks specifically of the importance of human-centred design because he sees traditional architecture as missing a critical piece of the puzzle. Traditional architecture can get caught in the trap of aesthetics only, without truly considering how people will interact with buildings. It is only through immersing yourself in a community that true discovery of the way people interact with the environment can be understood and built for. Rob has a keen interest in seeing cities develop sustainably on all levels, with a specific interest in the role that people play in shaping cities.    
        </p><p class="blog-qoute">“Human-centered design is a process that starts with the people you're designing for and ends with new solutions that are tailor made to suit their needs.”<a href="http://www.designkit.org/human-centered-design "> IDEO</a>
        </p><p class="blog-text">The isolation of modern living is an important factor to consider when aiming for a more community-inclusive focus. Lived experience can give designers a depth of understanding which uncovers the true needs of users to deliver real value back to communities. Through involving those who live in these buildings in the design process they feel a greater sense of ownership in it. In the end, you will have a more positive outcome and empower individuals to have a voice in their built community. This plays a critical role in fostering community. Co-housing movements are becoming more popular; an example Rob and I specifically discussed is The Commons in Brunswick, Victoria. The Commons is developed by <a href="http://nightingalehousing.org">Nightingale Housing,</a> which builds co-housing apartments to actively encourage community. Nightingale Housing is a “not-for-profit social enterprise that exists to support, promote and advocate for high-quality housing that is ecologically, socially, financially sustainable.”  
        </p><p class="blog-text">By including the users in the design process, architecture can have a real impact on the community rather than only being accessible to a few people. Rob feels that some aspects of architecture and design have become too abstract and there is no longer a focus on how people practically use space. Rob muses about the debate on this topic and sums up his thinking by saying, “At it’s core, architecture is about providing shelter and housing: if it can’t do this, then what’s the point?” Architecture, a profession steeped in academia, can tend to only service itself, and not the communities which it impacts. Rob feels that particularly as architecture involves such large-scale projects, the fact that great architects go unquestioned in their process is problematic. There is a shift in the industry, however, with an increasing focus on the positive impacts that the built environment can have on communities. The movement is gaining momentum, yet there are some key changes which Rob believes need to occur in the delivery of tertiary education in these disciplines. Many architecture and engineering course are largely focused on aesthetics and theory, yet need to have a more practical lens in order for the industry to approach sustainable design more holistically.      
        </p><p class="blog-text">Rob mentions that within the discipline of architecture there is encouragement to be creative and challenge what has been before. To make a difference to how people experience the built environment, and begin to affect change in the current approach to architecture and design, “think global, act local” is one which speaks true for Rob. Really understanding the particular needs of a community is more impactful than trying to solve different global problems from your one context. There is a strong sense of drive for Rob to use the opportunities he has to make a difference in the possible future of our environment and the reality of modern living. Rob aims to be part of the next evolution of architecture, one which puts people at the centre and achieves sustainable design in a holistic and accessible manner.
